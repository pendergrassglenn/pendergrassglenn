### Founder | Systems Architect | GenAI Dynamics

Builder of advanced AI, cybersecurity, and autonomous intelligence systems engineered for real-world deployment.

I design sovereign AI infrastructure, multi-agent orchestration platforms, OSINT intelligence systems, and cyber defense tooling focused on resilience, autonomy, and operational capability.

GenAI Dynamics exists to push beyond theory — building hardened, deployable systems that function in real environments under real constraints.
